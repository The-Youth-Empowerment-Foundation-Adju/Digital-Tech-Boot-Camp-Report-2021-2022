In the third week,they were introduced to coding basics and web development which lasted five weeks

In the eighth week, they covered the introduction to Git and GitHub use by Hakim from Carlton University in form of a workshop which was done virtually. 

In the ninth week, workshop II was conducted in-person to train the participants in GitHub uses.

The trainees learned to create Repositories, fork, create files in GitHub repository, commit changes in GitHub, GitHub issues, pull requests, merge pull requests, Branches, markdown files. 

The trainees demonstrated the ability to comfortably use GitHub as a collaborating software for knowledge sharing, they used it to document the web development training guide to make it accessible to the community.

In the tenth week, the lead trainer started the basics of web design which was covered up to week eight.

In the Eleventh week, another expert <KasiryeLabs> was invited for 3 days of hands-on training in WordPress ,web development and content management.
