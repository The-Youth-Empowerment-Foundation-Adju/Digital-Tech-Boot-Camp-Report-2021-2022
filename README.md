# The overall project assessment.
The boot camp started with an orientaion of the participants to the program as a kick off to the training, this was followed by one week basic computer skills assessed by the lead trainer.

In the third week,they were introduced to coding basics and web development which lasted five weeks

In the eighth week, they covered the introduction to Git and GitHub use by Hakim from Carlton University in form of a workshop which was done virtually. 

In the ninth week, workshop II was conducted in-person to train the participants in GitHub uses.

The trainees learned to create Repositories, fork, create files in GitHub repository, commit changes in GitHub, GitHub issues, pull requests, merge pull requests, Branches, markdown files. 

The trainees demonstrated the ability to comfortably use GitHub as a collaborating software for knowledge sharing, they used it to document the web development training guide to make it accessible to the community.

In the tenth week, the lead trainer started the basics of web design which was covered up to week eight.

In the Eleventh week, another expert <KasiryeLabs> was invited for 3 days of hands-on training in WordPress ,web development and content management.
  
The areas covered in the website included; content management system, local installation of WordPress, local servers i.e. using Xamp as a local server, troubleshooting websites, introduction to page builders e.g. elementor, introduction to themes and plugins, and web content strategies. 
 
 The participants teamed up to build the RefugeeConnect website, an information platform that publishes content about refugees and makes access to information easy for them.

  # long-term
  
  - The project has strengthened the relationship between the organisation and the host community,In the way that continuation of it will lead to rteduction of the alarming number of school dropout within the settlement which will improve their livelihood.
  
  - capacity building ,the trained participants are now able to solve media related technicalities by themselves,And they are dispersing the skills to the ones who are yet to be recruited.
  # Achievements;
  
  - The project improved the skills of participants in the use of basic computer applications and internet use. 
  
  - The trainer possessed the necessary skills to train, we also invited experts to conduct workshops and the participants demonstrated a willingness to learn.
  
  - Some participants were slow to learn; they were given more time to practice which slowed down the training progress ,but  however,we managed to meet the schedule by teaming them up through peer-to-peer learning sessions. 
  
  - The peer-to-peer teaming up has helped the participants to develop working together and sharing skills.
  
  - The boot camp training was planned to have 10 participants, however, we enrolled 9 participants due to a shortage of computers for use. We had 6 computers and 3 of the participants came with their own. 
  
  - The project has overall archived its objectives, the participants were able to gain knowledge and practices developed website <RefugeeConnect >not hosted online yet, they also learned content creation and publication on the websites, this has helped them understand much better the origin of information online. Thus ,it made them understand how media works.
  
  - They also acquired skills in the use of documentation/ collaborating software GitHub to share knowledge and collaborate in creating programs.
  
  # Challenges;
  
  - Some participants were slow to learn; they were given more time to practice which slowed down the training progress ,but  however,we managed to meet the schedule by teaming them up through peer-to-peer learning sessions.
  
  - Most of the trainees had limited exposure to computers (Majority do not own computers), this slowed the training progress, we also underestimated the costs for expert fees, hence we couldnâ€™t afford to hire one for App development. 
   
  - The boot camp training was planned to have 10 participants, however, we enrolled 9 participants due to a shortage of computers for use. We had 6 computers and 3 of the participants came with their own.
  
  - There was aproblem of power,due to hiking of fuel prices It has been a great challenge as working hours reduced with an aim of utilizing the little budget for fuel.
  
  - The training gadgets were not enough for participants for example computers.
  # Sustainability;
  
  - The participants have formed a network of experts on web developments,We will facilitate them with computers,power,space and market them to the business entities and other community based organizations to build them website.The website they built< RefugeesConnect> will generate them money in adverts to keep it running by host fee renewal.
