# long-term
  
  - The project has strengthened the relationship between the organisation and the host community,In the way that continuation of it will lead to rteduction of the alarming number of school dropout within the settlement which will improve their livelihood.
  
  - capacity building ,the trained participants are now able to solve media related technicalities by themselves,And they are dispersing the skills to the ones who are yet to be recruited.

# Achievements
  
  - The project improved the skills of participants in the use of basic computer applications and internet use. 
    
    ![](Images/IMG_20220520_212514_543.jpg)
  
  - The trainer possessed the necessary skills to train, we also invited experts to conduct workshops and the participants demonstrated a willingness to learn.
  
  - Some participants were slow to learn; they were given more time to practice which slowed down the training progress ,but  however,we managed to meet the schedule by teaming them up through peer-to-peer learning sessions. 
  
  - The peer-to-peer teaming up has helped the participants to develop working together and sharing skills.
    
    ![](Images/IMG_20220520_212553_727.jpg)
  
  - The boot camp training was planned to have 10 participants, however, we enrolled 9 participants due to a shortage of computers for use. We had 6 computers and 3 of the participants came with their own. 
  
  - The project has overall archived its objectives, the participants were able to gain knowledge and practiced by developing website ***RefugeeConnect*** not hosted online yet, they also learned ***content creation and publication on the websites***, this has helped them understand much better the ***origin of information online***. Thus ,it made them understand how ***media*** works.
    
    ![](Images/IMG_20220520_212741_133.jpg)
  
  - They also acquired skills in the use of ***documentation/ collaborating software GitHub to share knowledge and collaborate*** in creating respository/projects.

# Challenges
  
  - Some participants were slow to learn; they were ***given more time to practice which slowed down the training progress*** ,but  however,we managed to meet the schedule by teaming them up through peer-to-peer learning sessions.
  
  - Most of the trainees had limited exposure to computers ***(Majority do not own computers)***, this slowed the training ***progress***, we also underestimated the costs for ***expert fee***, hence we couldn’t afford to ***hire one for App development***. 
   
  - The boot camp training was planned to have ***10 participants***, however, we ***enrolled 9 participants*** due to a ***shortage of computers*** for use. We had ***6 computers*** and ***3 of the participants came with their own***.
  
  - There was aproblem of ***power***,due to ***hiking of fuel prices***, It has been a great challenge as working hours reduced with an aim of utilizing the little budget for fuel.
  
  - The ***training gadgets*** were not enough for participants for example ***computers***.

# Sustainability
  
  - The participants have formed a network of experts on web development and we are willing to facilitate them with ***computers***,***power***,***space*** and ***market*** them to the ***business entities*** and ***other community based organizations to build them websites***. The website they built ***Refugeeconnect*** will generate them through ***adverts*** to keep it running by host fee renewal.

The word ‘open’ is borrowed from the tech world and is used to describe something (texts, software, technology, information) that is accessible by the general public, and is free to be used and redistributed without legal or technological restrictions, removing barriers that might otherwise stand between individuals and the information they need

**ASKnet** is a network of hubs and community members who subscribe to the vision of;

**Educating on media literacy**.
**Creating communities with hands on experience while providing open access to skills and knowledge** that can **impact a community using the available resources**

So **ASKnet** has projects ready,look for funding through **r0g** and pass them to implementing partners like in this case **YEF**.

**YEF** (The Youth Empowerment Foundation) the implementing partner located in pagirinya refugee camp in northern Uganda. 

"**Who is YEF**"?

The Youth Empowerment Foundation Uganda is **a community based organisation that aims to mobilise and support young people in refugees and host communities** .
