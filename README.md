# long-term
  
  - The project has strengthened the relationship between the organisation and the host community,In the way that continuation of it will lead to rteduction of the alarming number of school dropout within the settlement which will improve their livelihood.
  
  - capacity building ,the trained participants are now able to solve media related technicalities by themselves,And they are dispersing the skills to the ones who are yet to be recruited.
# Achievements
  
  - The project improved the skills of participants in the use of basic computer applications and internet use. 
  
  - The trainer possessed the necessary skills to train, we also invited experts to conduct workshops and the participants demonstrated a willingness to learn.
  
  - Some participants were slow to learn; they were given more time to practice which slowed down the training progress ,but  however,we managed to meet the schedule by teaming them up through peer-to-peer learning sessions. 
  
  - The peer-to-peer teaming up has helped the participants to develop working together and sharing skills.
  
  - The boot camp training was planned to have 10 participants, however, we enrolled 9 participants due to a shortage of computers for use. We had 6 computers and 3 of the participants came with their own. 
  
  - The project has overall archived its objectives, the participants were able to gain knowledge and practices developed website <RefugeeConnect >not hosted online yet, they also learned content creation and publication on the websites, this has helped them understand much better the origin of information online. Thus ,it made them understand how media works.
  
  - They also acquired skills in the use of documentation/ collaborating software GitHub to share knowledge and collaborate in creating programs.
  
# Challenges
  
  - Some participants were slow to learn; they were **given more time to practice which slowed down the training progress** ,but  however,we managed to meet the schedule by teaming them up through peer-to-peer learning sessions.
  
  - Most of the trainees had limited exposure to computers **(Majority do not own computers)**, this slowed the training **progress**, we also underestimated the costs for **expert fee**, hence we couldnâ€™t afford to **hire one for App development**. 
   
  - The boot camp training was planned to have **10 participants**, however, we **enrolled 9 participants** due to a **shortage of computers** for use. We had **6 computers** and **3 of the participants came with their own**.
  
  - There was aproblem of **power**,due to **hiking of fuel prices**, It has been a great challenge as working hours reduced with an aim of utilizing the little budget for fuel.
  
  - The **training gadgets** were not enough for participants for example **computers**.
# Sustainability
  
  - The participants have formed a network of experts on web developments,We will facilitate them with computers,power,space and market them to the business entities and other community based organizations to build them website.The website they built< RefugeesConnect> will generate them money in adverts to keep it running by host fee renewal.
